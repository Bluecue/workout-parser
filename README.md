# workout-parser Python application
> Copy and paste plaintext workout logs generated from Strong workout tracker app to get sets broken down by muscle group

## Input Text Formatting
It is important that the copy-pasted text have some where in it this format  

 "number of sets for muscle group" x "muscle-group"

After you copy and paste this, it will give you a readout of the total sets per muscle groups. It is essentially a useful calculator that takes in text and spits out a summary of your weekly workout volume.

## Contribution
Much of this code was initially AI generated using ChatGPT as I am still learning regex. I modified and iterated the code to improve the way it handled diferrent input formats. It is still a work in progress.
